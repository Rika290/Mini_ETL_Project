Mini Data Engineering Project:
- Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline: extracted data from an API, transformed it with Pandas, and loaded it into Snowflake.
- Automated the workflow using Apache Airflow, ensuring reproducibility and scheduling.
- Implemented version control with Git & GitHub for collaboration and tracking changes.
- Strengthened hands-on experience with data pipelines, cloud data warehouse integration, and workflow orchestration.
